BAKING POWDER:
a.  This cake is meant to be super moist and fudgy. If you like a fluffier cake, use 2 teaspoons baking powder. Any more than that and your cake will rise too much and crack through the middle.
b. Baking soda is not needed in this recipe.

SPRINGFORM PAN (PLEASE NOTE):

a. Springform pans are NOT 100% leakproof. Very thin cake batters such as this one will leak through the base. To combat this issue, line the base with parchment paper coming up where the sides meets the base to create a 'cover'. Place a baking sheet on the shelf below the cake pan (or the bottom of the oven) to catch any stray drips (don't put cake pans directly on the pan).
